This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.5.

# Project description:
This project has been developed using Angular and Python. I have used ng2-charts to display the chart. For developing the Irradiance chart, I had to create an API. This API I have developed this using Python, flask, and PV Lib.API is hosted here: https://manishkumardsi.pythonanywhere.com/?lat=12&lon=50 and its code can be found here https://github.com/manishkumar-dsi/weather-app/blob/master/python-flask.py (Though the free hosting is expired now so if you want to use it then please host this script)
